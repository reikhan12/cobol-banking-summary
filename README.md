# ðŸ’³ COBOL Banking Transaction Summary

This project is a COBOL-based banking summary tool that processes financial transaction records and generates per-customer summaries including deposits, withdrawals, and transfers. It also identifies the most active customer and filters transactions by date.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Reads fixed-format banking transactions from a text file
- Calculates total deposits, withdrawals, and transfers per customer
- Identifies the customer with the highest number of transactions
- Filters records by transaction date (e.g., from 2024-01-01 onward)
- Outputs a structured summary to a new file

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `myproject.cob` | Main COBOL source code |
| `transactions.txt` | Sample input data |
| `summary.txt` | Output summary generated by the program |
| `README.md` | Project documentation |

## ðŸ“Œ Example Input (`transactions.txt`)

TXN9412011085 ACC58958 Withdrawal 00529 2025-01-17 10:51:00 TXN4247571145 ACC60921 Deposit 00933 2025-01-17 10:25:00 TXN2214150284 ACC48650 Transfer 01129 2025-01-17 10:56:00 ...


## ðŸ“Œ Example Output (`summary.txt`)

ACC58958 | Deposits: 000000 | Withdrawals: 000529 | Transfers: 000000 | Count: 0001 ACC48650 | Deposits: 000000 | Withdrawals: 000000 | Transfers: 001129 | Count: 0001 ... Top Customer: ACC58958 | Transactions: 0001


## ðŸ’¡ Technologies Used

- [GnuCOBOL](https://gnucobol.sourceforge.io/) for compiling and running COBOL on Mac
- Terminal-based execution (no JCL required)
- Classic COBOL concepts like `WORKING-STORAGE`, `FILE SECTION`, and `PROCEDURE DIVISION`

## ðŸ§  Why This Project?

As a Data Science student with a finance background, I explored COBOL to understand legacy systems used in banking. This project demonstrates my ability to work with structured data, create functional programs in older languages, and build bridges between traditional and modern technologies.
